#tuple is same as list
#tuple is immutable - we cannot change the values

tup = (21,36,15,22)
tup

tup[1]

tup.count()
#count() : provide the value to be counted
#tuple iteration is faster than the list
#sometimes we use tuples
#When we not change the values of the list i.e, tuple   


####Sets
#collection of unique elements
#we use { } for sets

s = {63,96,75,25,14,99,60,15,60}

#it not follow the sequence

s

#can we change the values ? Yes

#indexing cannot be performed
